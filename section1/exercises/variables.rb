# In the below exercises, write code that achieves
# the desired result. To check your work, run this
# file by entering the following command in your terminal:
# `ruby section1/exercises/variables.rb`

# Example: Write code that saves your name to a variable and
# prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
name = "Harry Potter"
p name

# Write code that saves the string 'Dobby' to a variable and
# prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
house_elf = "Dobby"
puts house_elf

# Write code that saves the string 'Harry Potter must not return to Hogwarts!'
# and prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
warning_dobby = "Harry Potter must not return to Hogwarts!"
puts warning_dobby
# Write code that adds 2 to the `students` variable and
# prints the result:
students = 22
# YOUR CODE HERE
p students
new_count = students + 2
puts new_count
# Write code that subracts 2 from the `students` variable and
# prints the result:
# YOUR CODE HERE
p students
minus_students = students - 2
puts minus_students

# YOU DO:
# Declare three variables, named `first_name`, `is_hungry` and `number_of_pets`.
# Store the appropriate data types in each.
# print all three variables to the terminal.
first_name = "Joseph"
is_hungry = "nope"
number_of_pets = 0
puts first_name
puts is_hungry
puts number_of_pets
# IN WORDS:
# How did you decide to use the data type you did for each of the three variables above?

# Explain.
#first_name and is_hungry were asking for strings so I put that data type for those variables.
#number_of_pets was asking for a number so I put an integer as the variable.

# YOU DO:
# Re-assign the values to the three variables from the previous challenge to different values (but same data type).
# print all three variables to the terminal.
first_name = "Donny"
is_hungry = "for sausage"
number_of_pets = 3
puts first_name
puts is_hungry
puts number_of_pets

# YOU DO:
# Using the variables below, print the total number of snacks to the terminal:
healthy_snacks = 6;
junk_food_snacks = 8;
total_snacks = healthy_snacks + junk_food_snacks
puts total_snacks

# FINAL CHECK
#-------------------

# Did you run this file in your terminal to make sure everything printed out to the terminal
  # as you would expect?
#Yes
