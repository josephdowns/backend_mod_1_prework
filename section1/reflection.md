## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

I really appreciated the author stating that teaching something was a part of the learning process. Once I feel like I can grasp something is the moment I feel like I can teach someone else. And usually, I end up learning more. I try to read as much as I can. Anything and everything. I would just say that I think a SuperLearner wants to pursue knowledge for knowledge sake. That they value any and all education.
