## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

* SMART or Setting Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and
Time-bound goals. I feel like most of my life I have been told to make
lofty goals or they were not count. SMART is a way to grow and obtain
goals.
* That mistakes are part of the process. It seems like I punish myself
whenever I make a mistake. By saying that mistakes are part of the
process, it takes some pressure off.

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

* I like to stay in my comfort zone and do little things that push me out of that box, not big things that would freak me out. It is similar to the Zone of Proximal Development.
* I don't like to practice. To have a Growth Mindset it is important to practice your coding skills and then that is how to master it.

1. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array?

A hash is a collection similar to an array. But a hash contains two pieces of information associated with each item where an array only has one.

1. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.

````ruby
pet_store = {
  "dog food" => 150,
  "cat chow" => 120,
  "fish flakes" => 300
}
````
1. Given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?

`states["IA"]`

1. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  How about all the values?

`states.keys`
`states.values`

1. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In your example, why is a hash better than an array?

* Say we had a group of first-graders and we wanted to associate each student with their favorite super hero. Using an array we could use the students' names as keys and the super heroes as values.
* An array would not let us associate the students with the super heroes. Using an array we could either access the student to find their favorite super hero or we could look up the super hero and see who loves them.

1. What questions do you still have about hashes?

None at this time.
